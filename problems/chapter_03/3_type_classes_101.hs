-- Define pi in several different ways by converting the

-- a float version, a double version, and a version
-- that will work for any readable type.

-- BONUS: Try to make the polymorphic safer by having
-- it fail with a type error rather than an exception
-- if a type that can't represent pi is requested.

-- Define a function (with type declaration)
-- that will accept a value and product a list
-- of the next three values in the series. It
-- should work for any type that supports the
-- succ function


-- Define a function (with type declaration)
-- that adds the square of two any numbers.


-- Define a function (with type declaration)
-- that uses sqrt and your adding squares
-- function from above to calculate the
-- length of the hypotenuse of a triangle.



-- Define a funtion (with type declaration)
-- and takes two values and returns a string
-- showing the values separated by ": ", as
-- if they were key and value in a dictionary.


-- Define a polymorphic constant that will
-- give all the possible values of a type that
-- is both bounded and enumerable.


-- BONUS: Define new versions of your squaring
-- and hypotenuse functions that allow the
-- parameters to be of *different* types. You can
-- assume the values are able to be converted to
-- integers.
